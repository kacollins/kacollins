### I go by Kimberly!

I'm a C#.NET software engineer and SQL Server database consultant with 19 years of experience developing and maintaining databases, web applications, desktop applications, and reports.

My favorite projects involve providing database consulting, designing and developing a database, or rewriting a legacy application. I specialize in helping small businesses that have outdated web or desktop applications or even Excel solutions that aren't working well for them anymore. 

In addition to my technical skills, Iâ€™ve been an event organizer and mentor in the local tech community for the past 9 years.
