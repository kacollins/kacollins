### I go by Kimberly!

I'm interested in learning about part-time opportunities where I can apply the skills I've gained so far in my career and learn some new ones! I've mostly worked with C# and SQL Server for the past 14 years, and I have experience with a few other technologies. 

Here's what I've been up to lately:
* 7+ years as a .NET developer at a consulting company in OKC
* 3+ years working with clients as a software engineer and database consultant
* Thousands of hours teaching, organizing, and mentoring in the local tech community 

Personality:
* MBTI - [ISTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality)
* DISC - [Precisionist CS](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/disc-styles/conscientiousness)
* Enneagram - [Type 1](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-1)
